    set Authenticating is false when the async auth is completed. It is important to not here that
    the user is initialized as null and not an empty string. That is so that this function can work.
    as initializing it to an empty string will mean if no user is returned and setUser("") in 
    onAuthStateChanged is run, the  code below will not run. Of course null isn't the only way to achieve
    this effect.
